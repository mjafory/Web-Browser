# Web-Browser
An example of a web browser written in Python and utilizing the PyQt5 module is provided here. The MainWindow class represents the application window and contains a core web view for displaying online information. It includes capabilities like going to home (Google), forward and backward in the browser history, refreshing and halting page loading, and executing Google searches. The interface comprises URL and search input bars and a navigation toolbar. Using PyQt5, this code produces a basic but serviceable web browser, showing how to build a graphical web app in Python.
